The Odin Project: google-results difficult version project

I will be using Chrome dev tools to recreate a Google search results page.
From The Odin Project's [curriculum](http://www.theodinproject.com/courses/web-development-101/lessons/html-css)

The purpose of this project was to build from scratch a google search results page with strictly HTML/CSS.
